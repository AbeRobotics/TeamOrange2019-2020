## TeamCode Module

This will be where all code for team orange will be stored. Below are links that can help you get familiarized with the FTC code:

Link to a tutorial by FIRST on creating Op modes (read parts 14.5 and 14.6. Everything else doesn't apply to the code)
https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-tutorial.pdf

Link to the javadoc, where it explains what each method does
https://first-tech-challenge.github.io/SkyStone/doc/javadoc/index.html

If these do not help, there is also sample code in the teamcode that is a good way to start you off.
