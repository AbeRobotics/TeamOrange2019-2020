Link to the javadoc, where it explains what each method does:

If these do not help, there is also sample code in the teamcode that is a good way to start you off.

## Uploading Code

If you wish to upload a piece of code you've created, make sure you are uploading to the correct location (i.e. teamcode), then click "Upload Files" and add the file you wish to commit, then click "Commit". Once the commmit is verified by an owner of the repository, it will then be accessable from the repository.

## IMPORTANT

Even though it is not necessary to import the repository into your workspace to start coding, it might be helpfull to certain people who don't wan't constant errors on their screen. Since this code was ment to be used with Android Studio instead of eclipse or any other IDE, there will be some errors that will not go away. This is fine though, as we are only going to be importing the code onto the phones from the laptop
